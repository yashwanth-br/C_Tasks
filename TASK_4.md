# 1. Concatenate two Strings without using strcat function.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the String 1: Vidya
Enter the String 2: vardhaka

Before concatenation:
String 1: Vidya
String 2: vardhaka

After concatenation:
String 1: Vidyavardhaka
String 2: vardhaka
```

## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the String 1: Engine
Enter the String 2: ering

Before concatenation:
String 1: Engine
String 2: ering

After concatenation:
String 1: Engineering
String 2: ering
```


# 2. Find whether two strings are same without using strcmp function.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the String 1: Vidyavardhaka
Enter the String 2: Vidyavardhaka
Two strings are same!
```
## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the String 1: Engineering
Enter the String 2: engineering
Two strings are different!
```

# 3. Find whether the substring present in main string.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the String: Vidyavardhaka
Enter the substring: vardhaka
The substring is present from the index 5!
```
## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the String: Engineering
Enter the substring: college
The substring is NOT found in main string!
```

# 4. Replace the substring in the main string by another one as given by the user.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the String: Pinapple
Enter the substring: apple
Enter the substring to be replaced: orange
The Final string is "Pinorange"
```
## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the String: Pinapple
Enter the substring: orange
Enter the substring to be replaced: fruit
The substring is NOT found in main string!
```

# 5. Insert a substring in the middle of a string as given by the user.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the String: Pinapple
Enter the substring: orange
Enter the index from which the substring is to be inserted: 3
Final string is "Pinorangeapple"
```
## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the String: HelloWorld
Enter the substring: Awesome
Enter the index from which the substring is to be inserted: 5
