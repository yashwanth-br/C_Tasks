# 4. Find an element index in an array given by the user.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the number of elements of arrays: 10
Enter the number 1: 34
Enter the number 2: 23
Enter the number 3: 98
Enter the number 4: 72
Enter the number 5: 28

Enter the number 7: 54
Enter the number 8: 2
Enter the number 9: 41
Enter the number 10: 77

Enter the number to be found: 84

Number was found at index 5
```
Note: In the above example, Though the number 84 is 6th number in the array, it's index in the array is 5. If you still have any doubts you may contact us for clarification.

## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the number of elements of arrays: 6
Enter the number 1: 29
Enter the number 2: 51
Enter the number 3: 81
Enter the number 4: 110
Enter the number 5: 18
Enter the number 6: 64

Enter the number to be found: 45

Number was NOT found
```

# 5. Invert the array elements given by the user and put it to another array.

## Example Output 1

```bash
Enter the number of elements of arrays: 6
Enter the number 1: 48
Enter the number 2: 62
Enter the number 3: 95
Enter the number 4: 143
Enter the number 5: 31
Enter the number 6: 94

The Inverted array elements are:
94
31
143
95
62
48
```
Note: Here don't just print the elements of the array in the reverse order, you need to put it to another array and then print it.

## Example Output 2

```bash
Enter the number of elements of arrays: 8
Enter the number 1: 71
Enter the number 2: 85
Enter the number 3: 118
Enter the number 4: 166
Enter the number 5: 60
Enter the number 6: 117
Enter the number 5: 54
Enter the number 6: 117

The Inverted array elements are:
117
54
117
60
166
118
85
71
```
Note: Here don't just print the elements of the array in the reverse order, you need to put it to another array and then print it.
